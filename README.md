# Timelapse Camera Monitoring System

A Python-based camera monitoring system with Discord integration, motion detection, and automated timelapse creation capabilities.
> **⚠️ Note:**
> This script was developed for a specific robotics timelapse setup and will likely need modifications to suit your requirements. The code is provided as-is and may require adjustments for different environments or use cases.

## Features

- 📸 Real-time motion detection and capture
- 🤖 Discord bot integration with command interface
- 🎥 Automated timelapse creation
- 📁 SMB file sharing support
- ⏱️ Scheduled capture every 30 minutes
- 🔔 Configurable Discord notifications
- 📊 System monitoring and statistics
- 📝 Timesheet tracking and statistics (with reminder at your choice (mine is 1:30 PM))
- 🌡️ Heatmap generation and training
- 📧 Email reporting for timesheet statistics


## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Discord.py
- SMB support
- Raspberry Pi (recommended) or system with camera
- SMTP email access (for reporting features)
