## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Agame7k/Timelapse-project.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create `cred.env` file with your credentials:
```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_token
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id
SMB_USERNAME=your_smb_username
SMB_PASSWORD=your_smb_password
